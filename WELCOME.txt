  LTS and kernel 2.6.32-24.

- Software and security updates applied until 29 December 2010

- Firefox updated to version 3.6.13

  with the recently upstreamed gsmopen channel
  http://www.gsmopen.org


Thanks for your feedback! As a result of it, this version
includes a few cool requested features:

- BETTER LISTENING: We have updated the flash player and
  include the new audio flash player from the Word Press
community, Code thanks to Martin Laine
http://wpaudioplayer.com
  Flash support detection will warn users without Flash
plugin in their browser

- INTERRUPTABLE IVRs: Users can now interrupt a file played
  in an IVR by pressing any key.

- NEWS ALERTS CHANNEL: We have include a RSS reader that
  connects to our development channel so you can keep
updated of bug fixes and security updates!

- NETWORKING AUTODETECION: New section in the Dashboard to
  help you setup the IP configuration of Freedom Fone.
Freedom Fone autodetects the local and external IP
address  of your network. If you want to make Freedom Fone
available to the outside world, select the external IP
address and make sure that your router port-forwards port
80 to your internal server.

- QUICK FEEDBACKS: Our Leave-a-message (LAM) application now
  supports a basic and advance mode. In basic mode users can
just hang the phone without having to listen to their
recorded message. This option will help in countries with
very noisy lines where DTMF tones are difficult to detect.
In the advance version, LAM users that decide to finish
their message with the # key, can still play, delete and
save their messages.

- EXPORTING AUDIO: Both the files uploaded and received by
  LAM can be played with the new built-in flash media player. 
Now, all files can be downloaded out of Freedom Fone so you
can add them to your favourite player or broadcast them
using any third party application.

- MORE LOCALIZATION: Localization of Freedom Fone includes
  English, Swahili and Spanish and a language switcher to
set your favourite language.

 A Localization portal http://pootle.freedomfone.org is
ready to receive more translations! Register and localize
freedomfone!

- MORE AND BETTER DATA: Data mining of Call data Records


- BUGS FIXED: Lots of bug fixed and hopefully less bugs
  introduced. :)


GET YOUR MODEMS READY!
======================

Of the shelf Freedom Fone is ready to receive calls from low
cost GSM modems and SIP VoIP devices.
The USB modems are available at: http://www.mobigater.bg/.
Without any special USB hub, you can plug three USB modems
to your PC.

You can verify that the USB modems are detected and
available by issuing the command:

#/etc/init.d/gsmopen devices

Note: # represents the command line prompt

root@lupinus:/home/lupinus# /etc/init.d/gsmopen devices
Audio Devices List

/dev/ttyACM0

This output tell us that we have one GSM modem connected at
the serial port /dev/ttyACM0 and that the modem built-in
sound card is available as card 1.

There is plenty of information available about your GSM
modems by issuing the command:

root@lupinus:/home/lupinus# /etc/init.d/gsmopen status
Alternatively you can check the file
/var/tmp/gsmopen_boot.log

SIP gateways and Freedom Fone
=============================

If you want to have plenty of GSM channels you can consider
using a SIP based GSM gateway
like the 2N Telecommunications Voice Blue Lite.
http://www.2n.cz/en/products/gsm-gateways/voip/voiceblue-lite/

Freedom Fone has left the internal extensions 1000 to 1019
with password 1234 pre-configured so you can register
external SIP gateways.


SSH server
==========

For security reasons this distribution does not have the SSH
server activated, to activate the ssh server open a Terminal
and run the command:

#dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

The dpkg-reconfigure command will create unique
cryptographic keys for your server.


Network Auto-detection
======================

From version 1.6.5 you do not need to edit any configuration
files.

Freedom Fone tries to auto-detect your network configuration.
Freedom Fone runs DHCP client by default but it is highly
recommended to fix a IP address in your installation.

Audio files are streamed to the web browser, fixing an IP
address will ensure that streaming works smoothly.

Go to Dashboard > Settings and select the appropriate IP for
your setup.

Freedom Fone supports three different setups:

 * Standalone
The audio files can only be played from the local machine:
Select 127.0.0.1

 * LAN setup
The audio files are available to any computer in your local
network:
Select your internal IP (typically 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)

 * WAN setup (public internet)
The audio files are available to any computer in the world!
Select your external IP (autodetected) and make sure that
your router
is port forwarding port 80 to your internal IP address


Enjoy ff!
