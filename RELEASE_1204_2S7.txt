2014-1-15 Freedom Fone 2S7 aka Lycaon Sharicus 
================================================

This release includes significant changes with our previous release 2S4.
A list of the new features and improvements follows:

* 32/64 bits support
====================

Freedom Fone 2S7 will be able to work in both 32 and 64bits operative
systems.

* Full integration with Gammu SMS Daemon
========================================

We have extended the support for SMS and include the possibility of
using the open source Gammu SMS engine to send and receive SMSs. Freedom
Fone 2S6 includes support for multiple GSM dongle devices in Gammu.


* Full integration with multiple Office Routes
==============================================
We have extended the support for SMS with Office Route so we can receive
SMSs using multiple Office Routes. Each of the communication channels
(SIM card) is now mapped into a unique SMS inbox.


* Robust hardware detection
===========================
We have included a new component "hardware wizard". The hardware wizard
will detect any serial USB devices and prompt the user for its desire
usage. USB devices can be allocated as dedicated SMS gateways via Gammu
or SMS/Voice gateways via Freeswitch. Thanks to this new module, all
configuration files for Gammu (SMSD) and Freeswitch are auto generated.
Users no longer need to open a text editor to get the core setup up and
running

* Graphical interface for audio services
========================================
When users create a new leave a message service or IVR, they will no
longer need to edit the Freeswitch dialplan. A new view in the Freedom
Fone GUI allow users to map audio service into GSM channels.

Olaf Dunn contributed a graphical reporting tool to Freedom Fone that we
have merge with out code base.


* Sending SMSs via the Freedom Fone GUI

bulk SMS via Office Route or Gammu SMS dedicated devices.
