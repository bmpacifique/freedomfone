Included in the Backup_Restore folder on the desktop are two scripts that help you do a backup 
and restore of your database. The backup script is for backing up your database as well as the 
audio files in your voice menu(s) and Leave-a-message service(s).

**********************************BACKUP *******************************************************

To run the backup script click the terminal icon on the launcher bar on the left hand side.

At the command prompt type the following command:

sudo su

When prompted for a password, enter the login password you assigned Ubuntu during installation.
The default password for FFv2S7 is sharicus.

After succesfully entering the password type the following command:

cd Desktop/Backup_Restore

After the command above you run the script with the following command:

bash ./backup.sh

At the password prompt press "Enter" ie there is no password to provide.

NB Please note there is a dot(.) at the beginning of the command above.The command above should 
create a backup folder on your desktop, this will have the audio files as well as the database.

If you need to store the backup elswhere, copy the backup folder from your desktop. Since the 
backup script always creates a folder with the same name, rename the folder later to 
differentiate between your backups.	

***********************************RESTORE*****************************************************

For the restore script to work you have to put the backup files on the Desktop inside the 
"backup" folder as is specified in the backup.sh script.

To restore your database backup as well as the audio files, run the restore script by clicking
the terminal icon on the launcher bar on the left hand side.

At the command prompt type the following command:

sudo su

When prompted for a password, enter the login password you assigned Ubuntu during installation.
The default password for FFv2S7 is sharicus.

After succesfully entering the password type the following command

cd Desktop/Backup_Restore

After the command above you run the restore script with the following command:

bash ./restore.sh

The command above should restore the database and the audio files you had initially backed up.
