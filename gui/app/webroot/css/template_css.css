/***This css file is usually used by Joomla,
however we structure our templates a little
differently for optimized use, for example:
We have seperated the template into 2 main css docs,

**For STRUCTURAL CSS, please see, layout.css 
(this contains the dimensions and main page
layout, only to be edited if you want to change
the page structure)

**For all graphical elements, typography, colors,
fonts and main joomla styles, edit this document
***/

/*TIP
**Use this (template_css.css) css document to add 
styles that will be used in the backend editor when
adding or editing content, this will help you maintain
a consistent look and feel throughout your website 
for more information, please email info@joomlajunkie.com*/
